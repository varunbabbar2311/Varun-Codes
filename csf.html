Cyber forensics is a branch of digital forensic science pertaining to legal evidence found in cyber space and digital storage media. In the digital age, the need for cyber experts has grown exponentially as the country is heading towards an internet explosion mostly fuelled by e-commerce, e-banking, e-governance and the social media.The current budget allocation towards cyber security is Rs 42.2 crore ($7.76 million) for 2012-13, as against Rs 35.45 crore in 2010-11 out of the $30.4 billion value of India's IT domestic spends.

India has seen many attacks on its critical installations and the misuse of social media and internet has brought home the threat of cyber-terrorism, which cyber security experts say the country is poorly equipped to handle.

With cyber security impacting the country's security, the national security adviser, announced last month that the government is putting in place a national cyber security architecture to prevent sabotage, espionage and other forms of cyber threats.

The national cyber security policy proposed in 2011, will seek to defend national assets against cyber-attacks and seek to provide for protection of citizen’s information. It will also strengthen the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) to periodically audit, defend and spread awareness on cyber security besides encouraging open standards.<p>
